What lasting value survives from the vanished experience of an earlier day?What remains to me
when I have neglected the word of the gurus?

Having forsaken this land of the living, with its relatives and friends,I shall go somewhere
all alone. What to me is all that is dear or not dear?

This thought is with me always, night and day,sorrow is caused by the evil deed. How then can
I escape?

Whatever guilt I have gathered in my foolishness and delusion, alike the wrong of nature and
the wrong of commandment,

I confess it all as I stand before the Masters with clasped hands, affrighted with grief, and
making obesance again and again.

May my Lords take my transgression as it is; never more, O Masters, will I do this unholy work.
