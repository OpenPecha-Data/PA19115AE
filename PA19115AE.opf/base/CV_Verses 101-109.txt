Both directly and indirectly one must act only for the welfare of sentient beings.One should
bend everything to their welfare and to their Enlightenment.

One should never abandon, even for the sake of one’s life,a good friend who holds to the law
of the Bodhisattva and who is skilled in the ways of the Mahāyāna.

As indicated by the Śrīsaṃbhavavimokṣa, one ought to practice whatever is taught by the masters.From
the recitation of sūtras, both this one and others, that which has been spoken by
the Buddha is to be known.

The rules are seen in the sūtras. Because of this, one should recite the sūtras.And in the Ākāśagarbhasūtra
one should examine the root sins.

The Śikṣāsamuccaya certainly is to be looked at again and again,because good conduct is explained
there in detail.

Or else, in the meantime, one should consult the Sūtrasammucaya, as a compendium;and [its] companion
composed by the noble Nāgārjuna [should be studied] zealously.

After you have learned in the discipline wherein you are prohibited and wherein you are commanded,you
ought to act for the purpose of protecting the mind in all situations.

This, then, in brief, is the mark of total awareness:the continual examination of the state
of one’s body and of one’s mind.

Thus I read with the body, but what good is speaking and reading?What good is a mere medical
treatise to the sick?
