and discernment is hard to win; how shall we come to restrain the spirit from its wont of wandering?

There, too, the Spirit of Desire is labouring to cast us into deep hells; there evil paths abound,
and unbelief can scarce be overcome;

it is hard to win a brief return, exceeding hard for the Enlightened to arise to us; the torrent
of passion can scarce be stayed. Alas, how sorrow follows on sorrow!

Alas, how lamentable is the estate of them that are borne down in the floods of affliction,
and in their sore distress see not how sad their plight is,

like one who should again and again come forth from the waters of his bath and cast himself
into the fire, and so in their sore trouble deem themselves to be in happy estate!

As thus they live in sport that knows not of age and dissolution, dire afflictions will come
upon them, with Death in their forefront.

Then when will the day come when I may bring peace to them that are tortured in the fire of
sorrow by my ministrations of sweetness born from the rain-clouds of my righteousness,

and when I may reverently declare to the souls who imagine a real world that all is void,and
righteousness is gathered by looking beyond the Veiled Truth?
