so may I in various wise support the whole sphere of life lodged in space, until all be at peace.

As the Blessed of old took the Thought of Enlightenment and held fast to the rule for sons of
Enlightenment in the order thereof,

so do I frame the Thought of Enlightenment for the weal of the world, and so will I observe
these rules in their sequence.

When he has thus taken the Thought of Enlightenment in a spirit of grace, the sage must fill
his thought with gladness in order to strengthen the issue.

This day my birth is fruitful, my human life a blessing; this day have I been born in the race
of the Enlightened, now am I their son.

And henceforth mine is the task of them who work worthily of their race, lest any blemish fall
upon this stainless stock.

This Thought of Enlightenment has arisen within me I know not how, even as a gem might be gotten
by a blind man from a dunghill;

it is an elixir made to destroy death in the world, an unfailing treasure to relieve the world’s
poverty,

a supreme balm to allay the world’s sickness, a tree under which may rest all creatures wearied
with wandering over life’s paths,

a bridge open to all wayfarers for passing over hard ways, a moon of thought arising to cool
the fever of the world’s sin,

a great sun driving away the gloom of the world’s ignorance, a fresh butter created by the churning
of the milk of the Good Law.

For the caravan of beings who wander through life’s paths hungering to taste of happiness this
banquet of bliss is prepared, that will satisfy all creatures coming to it.

I summon to-day the world to the estate of Enlightenment, and meanwhile to happiness; may gods,
daemons, and other beings rejoice in the presence of all the Saviours!
