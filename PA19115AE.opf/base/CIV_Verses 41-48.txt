Ah, when I vowed to deliver all beings within the bounds of space in its ten points from the
Passions, I myself had not won deliverance from the Passions.

Knowing not my own measure, I spoke like a madman. Then I will never turn back from smiting
the Passions.

I will grapple with them, will wrathfully make war on them all except the passion that makes
for the destruction of the Passions.

Although my bowels ooze out and my head falls,I will not bow before my everlasting enemies,
the passions.

An enemy, though driven away, may establish himself in another spot, whence he may return with
gathered powers; but such is not the way of the enemy Passion.

Where can this dweller in my spirit go when I cast him out; where can he stand, to labour for
my destruction? It is only that I – fool that I am – make no effort; the miserable Passions
are to be overcome by the vision of wisdom.

The Passions lie not in the objects of sense, nor in the sense-organs, nor between them, nor
elsewhere; where do they lie? And yet they disturb the whole world! They are but a phantom.
Then cast away thy heart’s terror, and labour for wisdom; why shouldst thou vainly torture
thyself in hell?

Thus resolved, I will strive to fulfil the rule as it has been taught; how should he who needs
medicine find healing, if he departs from the physician’s command?
