It feels no love when I guard it, no hate when vultures devour it; then why do I love it?

I am angered when it is treated with scorn, delighted when it is honoured, but if it has no
knowledge, to what end is my toil?

My friends, forsooth, are they who wish well to this body; but all men wish well to their own
flesh, and why are not they also my friends?

So I have surrendered my body indifferently for the weal of the world; it is but an instrument
of work that I still bear it, with all its guilt.

Enough then of worldly ways! I follow in the path of the Wise, remembering the Discourse upon
Heedfulness and putting away sloth.

Just like the compassionate Sons of the Conqueror, I shall patiently accept what I have to do;for
if I do not make a constant effort day and night, when will my misery ever come to an
end?

To overcome the power of darkness I concentre my thought, drawing the spirit away from vain
paths and fixing it straightly upon its stay.
